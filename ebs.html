  <p style="text-align:center;"> The environment must be protected because it is important, it supports the survival of human beings, it is the source of natural resources, it supports biodiversity and offers remarkable beauty. We take for granted the planet we live on, for it is the only planet that can support life,as far as we know, but we are harming it. Earth itself is showing us that it is not okay, throwing tantrums and fits in the form of natural disasters.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">And what exactly is a natural disaster?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">They are natural events that causes great damage to lives, the environment, infrastructure, and economy. There are many natural disasters and a lot of damage in the after math. </p>

        <p><b>Earthquakes</b></p>
        <p><u>What it is:</u>  A sudden and violent shaking of the ground, sometimes causing great destruction, as a result of movements within the earth's crust or volcanic action.</p>

<p><u>Causes:</u>  Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake. </p>

<p><u>Effects:</u>  The environmental effects of it are that including surface faulting, tectonic uplift and subsidence, tsunamis, soil liquefaction, ground resonance, landslides and ground failure, either directly linked to a quake source or provoked by the ground shaking.</p>

<p><u>Damage Costs:</u>  Between $500 million and $1.1 billion.</p>

<p><u>Ex:</u>  The deadliest earthquake in recorded history struck Shensi province in China in 1556, killing about 830,000 people.</p>

      <div class="w3-container w3-bdcolor">
        <p><b>Volcanic Eruptions</b></p>
        <p><u>What it is:</u>   A volcanic eruption occurs when hot materials from the Earth's interior are thrown out of a volcano.</p>

<p><u>Causes:</u>  Volcanoes are formed by eruptions of lava and ash when magma rises through cracks or weak-spots in the Earth's crust. A build up of pressure in the earth is released, by things such as a plate movement which forces molten rock to exploded into the air causing a volcanic eruption.</p>

<p><u>Effects:</u>  They can cause rain, thunder and lightning. Volcanoes can also have long-term effects on the climate, making the world cooler. Fast-moving lava can kill people and falling ash can make it hard for them to breathe. They can also die from famine, fires and earthquakes which can be related to volcanoes.</p>

<p><u>Damage Costs:</u>  Planter's roads replacement costs are up to $10,700,
Federal Aid Roads are up to $52,000, & Country roads replacement costs are up to $212,250
</p>

<p><u>Ex:</u>  The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora was one of the most powerful in recorded history, with a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7, killing 92,000  people.</p>

        <p><b>Drought</b></p>
        <p><u>What it is:</u>  It is a natural disaster of below-average precipitation in a given region, resulting in prolonged shortages of water supply, whether it’s atmospheric, surface water or groundwater.</p>

<p><u>Causes:</u>  Land and water temperatures, air circulation and weather patterns, soil moisture levels, drought can also be a supply and demand of water issue.</p>

<p><u>Effects:</u>  Lower surface, lower flow levels, increased pollution of surface water, the drying out of wetlands, more and larger fires, losing biodiversity, worse health of trees and the appearance of pests.</p>

<p><u>Damage Costs:</u>  $9.5 billion per event.</p>

<p><u>Ex:</u>  The 2000s drought in Australia affected most of southern Australia, including its largest cities and largest agricultural region.</p>

        <p><b>Floods</b></p>
        <p><u>What it is:</u>   It is an overflow or abundance of water that submerges with land that is usually dry.</p>

<p><u>Causes:</u>  Heavy rainfall, long periods of rain, snowmelt, steep slopes, impermeable rock (doesn't allow water through), very wet, saturated soils, compacted or dry soil.</p>

<p><u>Effects:</u>  Loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases.</p>

<p><u>Damage Costs:</u>  For 9-12 inches of flood, the estimate is $18,930. At 18 inches, the estimated cost is $26,285</p>

<p><u>Ex:</u>  The 1931 China floods is the deadliest natural disaster in history by estimated death toll (1,000,000–4,000,000).</p>

        <p><b>Hurricanes</b></p>
        <p><u>What it is:</u>  A storm with a violent wind, in particular a tropical cyclone in the Caribbean.</p>

<p><u>Causes:</u>  Hurricanes start when warm, moist air from the ocean surface begins to rise rapidly, where it encounters cooler air that causes the warm water vapor to condense and to form storm clouds and drops of rain.</p>

<p><u>Effects:</u>  Heavy rains, high winds, a storm surge, and even tornadoes.</p>

<p><u>Damage Costs:</u>  Between $50 billion and $161 billion.</p>

<p><u>Ex:</u>  The Great Hurricane of 1780 is the deadliest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history, which resulted killing 22,000–27,501 people.</p>

        <p><b>Tornadoes</b></p>
        <p><u>What it is:</u>  Rapidly rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud.</p>

<p><u>Causes:</u>  Tornadoes form in unusually violent thunderstorms when there is sufficient instability and wind shear present in the lower atmosphere. Instability refers to unusually warm and humid conditions in the lower atmosphere, and possibly cooler than usual conditions in the upper atmosphere.</p>

<p><u>Effects:</u>  Massive destruction to homes, property, infrastructure and cause many deaths as well. Each year, about 60 people are killed by tornadoes, mostly from airborne debris.</p>

<p><u>Damage Costs:</u>  Tornadoes can cost up to $10 billion in the U.S.</p>

<p><u>Ex:</u>  The Daulatpur–Saturia tornado in Bangladesh on April 26, 1989, was the deadliest tornado in world history, which killed approximately 1,300 people.

    <h4 style="text-align:center;"><b><u>Insights</u></b></h4>
    <p>Scientists believe the reason behind global warming is due to the human expansion of the greenhouse effect, the warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space. Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><p>Water vapor</p></li>
	<li><p>Carbon dioxide (CO2)</p></li>
	<li><p>Methane</p></li>
	<li><p>Nitrous oxide</p></li>

This is one way I can show how much saving the environment means to me. </p>
	<p>My name is Maria Castro. I’m 17 years old. I’m a high school student. Since there is water shortage in some parts of the world, I like saving as much water as I can.

<p style="text-align:center;"><b><u>Guadalajara filled with ice. July 1, 2019</u></b></p>
	<p><div class="ia">The storm began at dawn, and continued through the night on Sunday morning, Jalisco's state capital seemed like a polar zone. Everything was covered by a white layer of frozen water, the people woke in confusion and was troubled to move above the ice.
The specialists clarified that it was a hail accumulation that developed as part of the storm of the night. The temperatures had reached 30 ° C (86 ° F) in past days, so the storm had shocked many.</p> </div>
	<p><u>Effects:</u> </p> 
<p><div class="ia">It grew up to 1.5 meters high in some low areas of the metropolitan area.
There have been no reports of accidents or human losses, but even so authorities were still assessing material damage on Money.</p> </div>
	<p><u>How was it possible for Guadalajara to wake up covered in ice?</u> </p>
<p><div class="ia">According to BBC Mundo, meteorologist Elizabeth Ramos, of the National Meteorological Service, a series of factors came together to produce this "unusual hail": </p> </div>
<ul>
<li><p>A wedge of low pressure that affected the area and that went from very low levels of surface to 10-20 kilometers
The arrival of a hot, damp air mass from the Gulf of Mexico that came from the East and went up against this disruption
The terrain itself, given that the state of Jalisco has a very important mountain area</p></li>
<li><p>"When this conjunction of the dry and humid air of the Gulf of Mexico occurred with this disturbance, clouds of great vertical development began to be generated", the expert comments.
According to Ramos, these clouds reached up to 18 km high and within them began ice cores.</p></li>
<li><p>"It was a very high cloud and the higher the cloud, the greater the generation of hail, " he says.</p></li>
<p><u>How strange was the phenomenon?</u></p>
<p><div class="ia">According to Ramos, due to its magnitude, it was a "very rare" phenomenon, of which there have been no reports in the locality for at least 20 years. However, he points out that the region where it occurred is located in an area called the "hail corridor," which in some ways makes the ice return rain a prevalent phenomenon.</p> </div>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b><u>Arctic cold wave in the United States. January 31, 2019. </b></u></p>
<p> <div class="ia">If the planet is going through a phase called "worldwide warming," why is it getting so cold in the U.S.? Why do states like North Dakota experience this week up to -53 ° C ( -63.4° F) heat sensations? Well, the answer is that "global warming" does not mean that we have to feel warm all the time in all parts of the world. Rising in a worrying way and that circumstances can be produced to shape extreme climate phenomena. The U.S. polar vortex may be one of them.</p> </div>
<p><u>Effects:</u> </p>
<p> <div class="ia">Scientists had been forecasting the Arctic cold wave for a long time. Several studies indicate that the catalyst is the warming of the Arctic, which contributes to the ocean to release more heat. This weakens the circulation of cold air across the North Pole and allows it to escape to the South.</p> </div>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b><u>The Equatorial Cold Tongue. June 27, 2019. </b></u></p>
<p> <div class="ia">Nicknamed the " cold equatorial tongue," an area in the Eastern Pacific where temperatures stay below other waters in the world, the fact that it has always been cooler than the rest of the Pacific is baffling. The great uncertainty that hasn't been explained for years is why The Cold Equatorial Tongue isn't heating up as all the surveys suggest it should happen, even mathematical calculations and computer forecast models indicate that over the past 60 years it should have warmed up by 0.8 ° C (33.44°F) or more, but in reality it has barely exceeded 0.4 ° C (32.72°F).</p> </div>
<p><u>Effects:</u> </p>
<p> <div class="ia">It actually plays a fundamental role in the global climate: it is one of the factors influencing the event of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a natural pattern that causes the western Pacific surface to cool or warm. Depending on the cycle in which El Niño is found, heavy rains or great droughts can devastate a large part of America, Asia and East Africa.</p> </div>
 
<p><u>Why do not you behave according to the models?</p></u>
<p> <div class="ia">Researchers have traditionally assumed as a rule that any discrepancy between real temperatures and those predicted by climate models is due to the natural variability of our planet. But for years, worldwide warming climate models — computerized simulations of what is anticipated to occur on Earth from increasing greenhouse gases — have proposed that the cold tongue must have started warming up decades earlier. Indeed, it should keep heating up now. </p> </div>
